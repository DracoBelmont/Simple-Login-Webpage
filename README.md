Simple-Login-Webpage

This is a simple login/logout single webpage in order to reinforce my front-end learning.

HTML: This is a login form that asks for usernam and password When user clicks "Confirm", this initiates the login() function 
      If username and password are filled in, the form is hidden and a greeting message is displayed 
      The "Log Out" button then becomes visible and when clicked, triggers the logout() function and resets the form

CSS: Basic styling along with some of my own adjustments to practice my CSS 
     The background does have a infinite transient loop placed on it 
     The button has a transient color styling on it as well

JavaScript: Using the DOM (Document Object Model) it handles the login by checking if the username and password are entered 
            When logged in, it hides the login form and displays a personalized greeting 
            The logout function hides the greeting and resets the form

Again, this was created using strictly basic front-end tools no backend code for now. 
If there is anything else that I can do to improve upon this like add a Signup feature or change the styling of the CSS 
or just about anything else that can be improved upon in my code using front end tools, don't hesistate to make some suggestions or just reach out. Thanks!
